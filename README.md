# Irys-storage
## Just an easy fun way of testing out irys storage 

## 1️⃣ Minimal Requirements
RAM	2 GB is enough; 4 GB recommended
Storage	~200 MB for Node.js, packages, and files
OS	Ubuntu 20.04+, any Linux distro, macOS, or Windows with Node.js
Network	Stable internet connection (uploads require network to Irys testnet)

## 2️⃣ Recommended for Comfort
RAM: 4–8 GB (for handling multiple uploads or large files)
Storage: 1 GB+ if you store multiple files locally
Network: 10 Mbps+ for faster uploads

## 3️⃣ Notes
Node.js handles the uploads; it’s not GPU-intensive.
Large bulk uploads (hundreds of files) may be limited by RAM and internet speed, but typical single-file or small batch uploads run fine on any laptop.
No special hardware like GPUs or SSDs is required.
